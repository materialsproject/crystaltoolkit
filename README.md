# Crystal Toolkit

# Call for new contributors

Crystal Toolkit is an academic project. A manuscript is in preparation to detail the design goals of Crystal Toolkit and achievements to date.

**If you are interested in getting involved in Crystal Toolkit and are not already, it is not too late to be included in this manuscript, but please get in touch with mkhorton@lbl.gov ASAP.** Include information on the specific contributions that you would like to make (e.g. this may include adding features, addressing bugs, writing documentation, manuscript preparation, community engagement, writing tests, and the like), and if these align with the project we can formally add you to the development team.

Following a discussion with a potential contributor, "new contributor" issues are assigned. A current list of new contributor issues can be seen [here](https://github.com/materialsproject/crystaltoolkit/labels/new-contributor).

## Future of This Repository

The Crystal Toolkit repo currently contains three major parts:

* An object-orientated Python framework for rendering materials science data based on the schema employed by the Materials Project
* A few custom Plotly Dash components (Simple3DSceneComponent, JSONComponent, GraphComponent)
* Some example apps using these components

It is likely the custom Plotly Dash components might be spun off into a separate repo at some point to reduce the complexity of the Crystal Toolkit repo itself.

Thank you to all the authors and maintainers of the libraries Crystal Toolkit
depends upon, and in particular [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org) for crystallographic
analysis and [Dash from Plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) for their web app framework.

Thank you to the [NERSC Spin](http://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) service for
hosting the app and for their technical support.
