============
Introduction
============

Crystal Toolkit is a web app framework from the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_
allowing Python developers to easily make an interactive web app to display materials science information.
As a showcase of the framework's capabilities, the Crystal Toolkit app allows you to import, view, analyze and
transform crystal structures and molecules.


Crystal Toolkit Demonstration App
---------------------------------

The new Materials Project website is powered by the Crystal Toolkit framework, visit it
`here. <https://next-gen.materialsproject.org>`_. This includes the original "Crystal
Toolkit" app `available here <https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/toolkit>`_.


Crystal Toolkit Web Framework
-----------------------------

Crystal Toolkit is designed as a modular, object-oriented suite of UI components
built upon the `Dash framework by Plotly <https://dash.plot.ly>`_. The Crystal Toolkit web app is just
one example of using these components.

The custom Dash components developed for use by Crystal Toolkit are available at
`dash-mp-components <https://github.com/materialsproject/dash-mp-components>`_, and
powered by our custom React components available at
`mp-react-components <https://github.com/materialsproject/mp-react-components>`_. These
can be explored interactively in our
`Storybook <https://materialsproject.github.io/mp-react-components/?path=/story/introduction-mp-react-components--page>`_.
These components can also be installed and used independently of Crystal Toolkit.

Installation
------------

You can ``pip install crystal-toolkit``.

For Jupyter integration, please see the `additional installation steps <jupyter>`_.


Dash 2.x Migration
------------------

Crystal Toolkit works with both Dash 1.x and Dash 2.x. Several design choices were made
before Dash 2.x was developed that may be re-evaluated in future as new functionality
becomes available.
